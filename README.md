C_DuringEducation
=================

C programs made during my education at Fitchburg State College.

I uploaded these files for those who would like to browse through the code I made during my education.

To run the programs please use Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. I apologize for the inconvenience at the moment. First open "Systems Programming.sln". From the file explorer, under source files, just right click the .c file there and exclude from project. Then right click source files -> add -> Existing Item. Locate the appropriate .c file you wish to see and add it. Then build and start without debugging. A brief description of the files should be found at the beginning of each file. The program currently included in the project should be the most recent of the programs made.

All of the programs are in named individual files in the "Systems Programming" folder. Please let me know if you need any assistance or find any issues with my programs.
